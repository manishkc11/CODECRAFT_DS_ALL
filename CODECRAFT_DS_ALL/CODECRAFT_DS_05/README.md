# CodeCraft Data Science Internship – Task 05

## 🎯 Task Objective

Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Time of day
- Accident severity
- Causes of accidents

## 🧹 Key Steps Performed

1. Cleaned and preprocessed the accident data.
2. Extracted the hour from accident times for hourly analysis.
3. Visualized:
   - Accident frequencies by time of day
   - Weather conditions during accidents
   - Severity of accidents
   - Road surface conditions
   - Most frequent causes of accidents
